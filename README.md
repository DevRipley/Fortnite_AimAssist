# Kio - Fortnite Aim Assist
KioAssist is a neural network aim assist that uses real-time object detection accelerated with CUDA on Nvidia GPUs.

## About

KioAssist can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using KioAssist is that it does not meddle with the memory of other processes.

The basis of KioAssist's player detection is the architecture written in Executable Windows Program.
